Form processor/generator package
--------------------------------

The form processor/generator package consists of three .php scripts, form_processor_init.php, form_processor.php, and form_generator.php; two .css files, form.css and genform.css; and two .js files, form_processor.js and set_visibility.js. There are several utility files which are included into the scripts.

form_processor.php is an all-purpose form processor, which you can use as the 'action' for any HTML form. It requires some hidden fields in the form, which are documented in the script's comments. form_processor_init.php is a set up program which allows you to store default values such as email recipient and data file format, which both form_processor.php and form_generator.php will use. form_generator.php creates and opens forms based on user input; see the script's comments for full details.

form.css is specifically for the scripts included in this package. genform.css is specifically for use with a form generated by form_generator.php; that script will automatically include a link to the genform.css file.

form_processor.js is used with generated forms to guarantee the inclusion and accuracy of required hidden files such as the field names and the data recipients email URL. set_visibility.js is a short file which manages the visibility of some fields in form_processor_init.php which are conditionally required depending on the values of other fields.

The data structure in the package should be maintained. You should have six sibling folders, _php, _js, _css, _includes, _classes, and _json. The _json folder contains only the JSON defaults file, which the scripts create if it does not exist.

This software is offered free of charge, and can be edited in any way necessary in your programming environment. Author assumes no responsibility for its performance. However, questions about the package and change requests can be addressed to bobtrigg94930@gmail.com.
